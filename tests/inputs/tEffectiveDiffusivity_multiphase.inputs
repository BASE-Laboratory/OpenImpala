# Input file for tEffectiveDiffusivity test with multi-phase transport coefficients
#
# Uses the same binary TIFF as the single-phase test, but activates both phases
# with different diffusion coefficients via the multi-phase code path.
# Phase 0 -> D = 0.5, Phase 1 -> D = 1.0
#
# This exercises:
#   - Multi-phase coefficient parsing in EffectiveDiffusivityHypre
#   - Variable-coefficient cell problem: nabla . (D nabla chi_k) = -nabla . (D e_k)
#   - D(x)-weighted D_eff tensor calculation in the test driver

# Path to the input image file (binary TIFF with phases 0 and 1)
