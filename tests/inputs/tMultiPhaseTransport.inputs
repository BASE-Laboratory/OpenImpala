# Input file for synthetic multi-phase transport test
#
# Creates a uniform 32^3 domain (all cells = phase 0) with D=1.0.
# For a uniform material with no obstacles, the expected tortuosity is 1.0.
#
# This validates:
#   - Multi-phase ParmParse parsing (tortuosity.active_phases / phase_diffusivities)
#   - isMultiPhase() API returns true
#   - getPhaseCoeffMap() returns correct entries
#   - Solver converges on synthetic uniform geometry
#   - Tortuosity matches analytical expectation (tau=1.0)
