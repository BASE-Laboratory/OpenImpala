# Input file for tTortuosity test with multi-phase transport coefficients
#
# Uses the same binary TIFF as the single-phase test, but activates both phases
# with different diffusion coefficients via the multi-phase code path.
# Phase 0 -> D = 1.0, Phase 1 -> D = 0.5
#
# This exercises:
#   - tortuosity.active_phases / tortuosity.phase_diffusivities parsing
#   - Coefficient MultiFab construction from phase map
#   - Binary traversable mask for multi-phase flood fill
#   - Harmonic mean face coefficients in variable-coefficient solver
#   - D_face-weighted flux calculation in global_fluxes()

# Path to the input image file (binary TIFF with phases 0 and 1)
