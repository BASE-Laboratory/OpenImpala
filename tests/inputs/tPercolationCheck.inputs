#==============================================================================
# Input file for tPercolationCheck test
#
# Tests the PercolationCheck class by reading a TIFF file, thresholding it,
# and checking whether the specified phase percolates in X, Y, and Z directions.

# Path to the input image file

# --- Phase Definition Parameters ---

# Threshold value applied to the raw data
threshold = 0.5

# Phase ID to check percolation for (1 = voxels above threshold)
phase_id = 1

# --- AMReX Grid Setup ---

# Maximum grid size for BoxArray decomposition
box_size = 32

# --- Test Behavior ---

# Verbosity level (0=minimal, 1=standard, 2=detailed)
verbose = 1

# --- Optional Expected Values ---
# Set to 0 (expect no percolation) or 1 (expect percolation) to enable checking.
# Set to -1 to skip the check for that direction.
