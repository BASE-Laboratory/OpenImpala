# Input file for synthetic two-phase transport test
#
# Creates a 32^3 domain with alternating layers of phase 0 and phase 1,
# both assigned D=1.0. Since all cells have the same diffusivity,
# the problem is equivalent to a uniform material.
# On a discrete N-cell grid, tau = (N-1)/N = 31/32 = 0.96875.
#
# This validates:
#   - Two-phase coefficient field construction
#   - Binary traversable mask across phase boundaries
#   - Flood fill connectivity across alternating phases
#   - Harmonic mean face coefficients at phase interfaces (D_face = 2*1*1/(1+1) = 1)
#   - Correct tortuosity for multi-phase uniform-D case
